# Automated-Greenhouse

Recent updates:

  1. Added logic for opening/closing vents. Vents will stay open if the outside temperature is within the specified range, or if it is too hot in the greenhouse.
  2. In order to aid in the ventilation logic, another temperature sensor has been added to monitor the outside temperature. The circuit has slightly changed to incorporate the second sensor.
